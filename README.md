## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.<br>
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.<br>
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.<br>
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.<br>
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.<br>

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.<br>
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.<br>
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.<br>
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.<br>
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.<br>
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.<br>
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.<br>
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.<br>
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.<br>
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.<br>

## Proposed Solution
### 1. Detailed explanation of the proposed solution

The proposed solution is an AI-powered, multilingual Digital Biosecurity Farm Management Portal designed specifically for pig and poultry farmers. This platform will offer features such as risk assessment tools, farm biosecurity planning, interactive training modules, real-time disease alerts, and digital compliance tracking. It enables farmers to perform farm risk evaluation, generate customized biosecurity plans, track farm hygiene records, maintain visitor and disease logs, and access government-approved guidelines.<br>
The portal will also connect farmers with veterinarians, extension workers, and authorities through integrated communication channels, promoting collaborative disease control.

### 2. How it addresses the problem

✔ Provides simple, farmer-friendly digital access to biosecurity practices in multilingual format.<br>
✔ Enables self-assessment for disease risk and readiness, reducing outbreak chances.<br>
✔ Offers real-time alerts about nearby diseases, helping farmers take preventive steps.<br>
✔ Tracks compliance with regulatory standards for certification and inspections.<br>
✔ Encourages collaboration between farmers, veterinarians, and policymakers.<br>
✔ Digital record-keeping supports surveillance, analytics, and data-driven policies.<br>

### 3. Innovation and uniqueness of the solution

🔹 AI-based personalized risk assessment and automated farm biosecurity planning.<br>
🔹 GIS-enabled disease heat maps showing real-time outbreak zones.<br>
🔹 IoT-based monitoring options for hygiene, temperature, and farm movement.<br>
🔹 Blockchain-enabled digital record management for transparent data sharing.<br>
🔹 Chatbot support in regional languages with voice assistance and image-based guidance.<br>
🔹 Gamified learning modules for better farmer engagement and training.<br>
